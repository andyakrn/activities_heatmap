This project contains code for processing activities with gpx-files from Garmin Connect.  To export activities from Garmin Connect use gcexport.py  from this repo: [garmin-connect-export](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export).


The jupyter notebook contains code for data processing and analysis. It includes data import and parsing, as well as visualization like charts, histograms, geographical maps, and heatmaps.
